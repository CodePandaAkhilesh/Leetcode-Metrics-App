# LeetCode Metrics App ðŸš€

## Project Overview
Welcome to the LeetCode Metrics App! This application allows users to fetch and display their LeetCode metrics simply by entering their username. Dive in to visualize your coding progress and stats!

## Features
- **User Search**: Enter any LeetCode username to retrieve their stats.
- **Progress Circles**: Visualize the number of solved problems in Easy, Medium, and Hard categories using conic gradients.
- **Dynamic Cards**: Display additional metrics such as:
  - Acceptance Rate
  - Ranking
  - Contribution Points
  - Reputation

## Technologies Used
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the app.
- **JavaScript**: To handle user input, fetch data from the LeetCode API, and update the UI dynamically.
- **Fetch API**: To make network requests and handle JSON responses.
- **Event Listeners**: To manage user interactions.
- **Regular Expressions**: To validate usernames and ensure they meet the criteria.

## Learning Highlights
- How to fetch and process data from a network using JSON.
- Utilizing conic gradients to create engaging visual progress indicators.
- Implementing responsive and interactive UI components with JavaScript.
